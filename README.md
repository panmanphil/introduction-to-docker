Slides and sample code from my talk "Introduction to Docker"

This was first done for my teammates at http://omniresources.com, and most recently for http://www.twincitiescodecamp.com/#/home in Minneapolis. Next up is That Conference in August, see you there.  

The node.js project I used as an example for the docker intro was a snapshot of https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter which also used a mongo database in a container. 

Any followup conversations will be posted to my blog, http://panmanphil.wordpress.com

Thanks to all that came to the talk!
