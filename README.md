Slides and sample code from my talk "Daring to Develop with Docker"

This was first done for my teammates at http://omniresources.com, for http://www.twincitiescodecamp.com/#/home in Minneapolis, and most recently for That Conference 2016.  

The node.js project I used as an example for the docker intro was a snapshot of https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter which also used a mongo database in a container. This most recent version also included a hello world style .net core container, includeding a failed attempt to use mongo with the beta driver for .net core. Work in progress! 

Any followup conversations will be posted to my blog, http://panmanphil.wordpress.com

Thanks to all that came to the talk!
